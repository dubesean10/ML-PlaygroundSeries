# ML-PlaygroundSeries

This is an investigation into the Playground Series Credit Card Fraud Detection on Kaggle. The
dataset was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Credit Card Fraud Detection. Our goal
is to construct several simple machine learning models which can predict the Class attribute using the
other attributes included in the dataset. This variable is binary, therefore, making this a binary
classification problem. First we investigated the properties of the dataset. Next, we selected a method for
imputing missing data values and prepared the dataset for use in modelling. Following this, a number of
models were assessed, these were: Stochastic Gradient Descent, Logistic Regression, Random Forest,
Decision Tree, and Histogram-Gradient Boosting classifiers. We assessed each model with a
performance measure and analysed the confusion matrices to assess the accuracy, precision, and recall
of each model. This report will explain the process for each section and conclude the research findings at
the end.
